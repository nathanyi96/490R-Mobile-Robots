Algorithm. For optimal path planning, we used a greedy algorithm that uses the Euclidean distance metric to determine the order that the waypoint goals should be navigated. We also use Dubins path planning algorithm to generate waypoints for paths between goal waypoints. Furthermore, we use cubic splining among the waypoints to determine optimal orientations and curvatures for Dubins path planning between goal waypoints.

Architecture. We implemented a ROS PathManagerNode that handles multiple waypoint goal path planning. The node calls on the ROSPLannerFinal (similar to ROSPlanner in lab2) to generate Dubin's path waypoints between goal waypoints and calls on the controller to execute the path.
