![Sanjiban Choudhury](/19sp/example_site/images/sachoudhury.png)


Sanjiban Choudhury completed his PhD in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, under the supervision of Prof. Sebastian Scherer. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at University of Washington working with Prof. Siddhartha Srinivasa. His research focus is on problems at the intersection of machine learning and motion planning. During his PhD, he developed the motion planning architecture, that integrated learning and planning, for an autonomous full-scale helicopter. Sanjiban has a MS from CMU, a BTech and MTech from IIT Kharagpur. He has also worked at Microsoft Research as in intern on imitation learning for sequential decision-making. He is a Siebel Scholar, class of 2013.

Colin Summers is a BS/MS student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering and is advised by Prof. Siddhartha Srinivasa. He is primarily interested in algorithms that enable intelligent machines to acquire general notions of intelligence in order to robustly solve complex and temporally-extended tasks in real-world settings. He is co-advised by Prof. Dieter Fox in the Robotics and State Estimation Lab and has previously interned at NASA JPL Robotics, NASA Glenn Research Center, and Blue Origin.
